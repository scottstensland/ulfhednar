	this dir has a fully self contained gRPC server and client


	# --- first launch server ... feel free to run this on a remote box or local


go run server.go


	# --- if running both server and client on same box  go ahead
	#     and ignore below export ... otherwise below cmd will
	#	  define host IP of remote server box so client knows where it is

export SERVER_PORT_GRPC_IMAGE_TO_SOUND=142.250.191.110:50051 # <-- use your IP this this sample


	client can run in two different modes 

	mode A
		client sends a jpeg image file up to server
		to which server will respond back to client with a wav audio file

go run client.go  -mode=image -image=./client_media/Albrecht_Durer_De_Heilige_Familie_met_de_libelle.jpeg  -float=3.14 -int=42 -string="example"


	mode B
		client uploads a wav codec audio file to server and gets
		in response back a jpeg image file


go run client.go  -mode=sound -sound=./client_media/bach_three_lute_pieces_andres_segovia_mono_simple_flow.wav -another_float=2.71 -another_int=100 -another_string="another_example"
